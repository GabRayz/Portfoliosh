# Portfoliosh

ðŸ—“ Date: 2022 ðŸ•™ Duration: 3 days

Still needs an introduction ? Well then, Portfoliosh is a portfolio that takes the form of a shell interpreter. The idea is to make something original
while promoting a technical aspect. No framework was used apart from Spring Boot. Contrary to 42sh, this shell does not implement all necessary
features.

## ðŸ§¬ Technologies :

- Java & Spring Boot (backend)
- Javascript (frontend)
- HTML and CSS
